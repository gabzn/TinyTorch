# TinyTorch/MiniTorch is a simplified version of the PyTorch library. Unlike PyTorch where all deep learning architectures are implemented and maintained by open-source developers, TinyTorch focuses on the core structures and the underlying system of deep learning.

# The goal of developing TinyTorch was to demystify deep learning architectures and learn about what's happening under the hood of PyTorch. Below is a list of the core structures TinyTorch focuses on:

  - Modules
  - Parameters
  - Autodifferentiation
  - GPU Operations
